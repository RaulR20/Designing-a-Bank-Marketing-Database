# Designing-a-Bank-Marketing-Database
Project guided by DataCamp 
"You have been asked to work with a bank to clean and store the data they collected as part of a recent marketing campaign, which aimed to get customers to take out a personal loan. They plan to conduct more marketing campaigns going forward so would like you to set up a PostgreSQL database to store this campaign's data, designing the schema in a way that would allow data from future campaigns to be easily imported."
